Dec 1 I think we need a new canvas to make the leaderboard look nice.
currently there are two canvases with id "myCanvas" and "myMatrix"
myCanvas is the main puzzle while myMatrix is for the 'stats'
I think the leaderboard would benefit from being on a third canvas.
myLeader can be the leaderboard canvas

Nov 21 https://www.zebrose.com/kzgames/top/top.html brings up puzzle images
Elf image brings up https://www.zebrose.com/kzgames/top/puzzle.html?Elf&$initials BROKE
remove last '&' https://www.zebrose.com/kzgames/top/puzzle.html?Elf  WORKS
leaderboard form https://www.zebrose.com/kzgames/lead/myleaderboard.html
 leaderboard form bring you to https://www.zebrose.com/kzgames/lead/myleaderboard.php?initials=KATE
    this presents page with 3 lines looking broken -- current website = ... Welcome ?>
So zebrose.com is pretty broken ... I won't touch it until I have something working on my computer
	

I am testing the puzzle on my local computer.
file:///C:/Users/kate/Documents/games/puzzle/myleaderboard/myleaderboard.html
  12/2 works on my local computer 
  11/21 works for numx=2 then when puzzle solved there is an error at game.js 162 
    function submitScore(){
    document.getElementById('initials').setAttribute('value', username);
	Uncaught TypeError: can't access property "naturalWidth", timg is null
    onload file:///C:/Users/kate/Documents/games/puzzle/myleaderboard/game.js:55


the URL for opening top.html with initials
file:///C:/Users/kate/Documents/games/puzzle/top/top.html?initials=xyz
  this URL presents the top page with a greeting for xyz, perfect
puzzle does not work!
  
file:///C:/Users/kate/Documents/games/puzzle/top/javascriptForm.html
  this URL presents a form asking for First Name and responds with 'Welcome xyz' after the form is submitted
  the welcome screen is on zebrose.com@https://zebrose.com/boodryspin/game0/WelcomeFormAction.php
  It leave poor xyz hanging with no path to the puzzle
  
  I also has lots of attempts on the server...
https://www.zebrose.com/kzgames/lead/myleaderboard.html
this one sends you to a deadend welcome message

the https://www.zebrose.com/kzgames/lead
  directory has lots of files most of which are not required for just the leaderboard function
  this whole directory should be removed once we have the leaderboard function nailed down
  
file:///C:/Users/kate/Documents/games/puzzle/leaderboard/myleaderboard.html
  this is the file that works in that is take the initials and tries to processes them
  unfortunately it fails in passing them on to the welcome screen
  
  on my local computer there are 2 leaderboard directories
  
  puzzle/leaderboard  AND puzzle/top/leaderboard
  
 the 'top' directory has a subdirectory with another leaderboard directory and another myleaderboard.html!!
  
    file:///C:/Users/kate/Documents/games/puzzle/top/leaderboard/simpleleaderboard/myleaderboard.html
	https://www.zebrose.com/kzgames/top/lead/myleaderboard.html
  
  The above link works in that it takes the users initials and brings the user to an updated top puzzle page.
  
  I will try the above on zebrose.com.
  
  https://www.zebrose.com/kzgames/top/lead/myleaderboard.html
      to enter initials
	  
	  tbl_puzzle_scores
	  INITIALS
	  DATE  auto fill
	  SCORE
	  CLICKS
	  NUM_PIECES
	  PUZZLE_IMAGE
	  
	  tbl_puzzle_scores
